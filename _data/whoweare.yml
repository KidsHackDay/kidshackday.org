      Working with the Kids Hack Day platform has been both fun and rewarding for us as students of the Digital Media Creative
      program at Hyper Island. Organizing a technology event for kids is the ultimate challenge in creativity. It taught us
      digital skills such as programming and digital marketing. It developed our event planning/execution and leadership skills.
      The initial nonexistent budget we started with also forced us to be resourceful in recruiting sponsors and also helped us to
      develop our skills in project management. Thankfully we had access to a huge space (our school Hyper Island) plus an amazing
      team of students volunteering at the event helping us manage the insane amount of kids that actually showed up (300!).

      The thing we enjoyed the most with the Kids Hack Day platform was that it allowed us to be creative in the way we wanted to
      adapt the event to our local context. It gave us guidelines and online resources to support us, but also enough freedom to add
      our own visions and ideas. The open and free of charge event format was a great way for us to contribute to a more inviting
      and inclusive society. Finally, we highly encourage anyone who wants to take on the challenge to organize a Kids Hack Day event.
      It is highly rewarding and lots of fun.

      Kids are such curious creatures. They wonder, analyze, question, and test, and by doing so, develop. If a child stays curious,
      he or she will continue to explore and discover throughout life. Kids Hack Day facilitates the tools and environment to both
      arouse and fuel that curiosity. Little minds are activated with the help of math, science and new technologies. The pleasure
      they get from the discovery and mastery of new skills is truly heartwarming. It makes their minds observant of new ideas, brings
      excitement into their day and opens up new worlds and possibilities. For too many kids, curiosity crumbles away as they grow up.
      In this age of complexity, curiosity perished is a future denied.

      Kids Hack Day adds a lot of credibility to local making events by making them part of a larger global movement. This made it
      easier to get corporate sponsors and attendees for our November 2015 event in Shanghai. The organization has been very supportive
      of our first Kids Hack Day in China spending significant amount of time and resources in helping us prepare the event and even
      more resources at the event itself. Without the key participation of some of the founders of Kids Hack Day, Quirkbot and Strawbees,
      the event could not have had the value, interest and impact it had. We are looking forward to the future of Kids Hack Day!

      We hope to foster an open learning environment and let kids discover the Joy of figuring things out themselves. Playing and
      testing out their ideas to discover their individual skills and abilities.
