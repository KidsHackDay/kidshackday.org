						Step 0: Check for events in your city
					</h4>
					<p>
						It's great to be able to organize a Kids Hack Day in your city. It's even greater when you realize more people want to do the same as you and maybe they have started already! So before anything else, check on our wiki if there is any event being planned in your city or if it already happened you can always get in touch to ask for inspiration and advices.

					<h4>
						Step 1: Create a team
					</h4>
					<p>
						We are stronger together, so finding a good team with complementary skills that all believe in your vision is essential. It's always nice to have someone to help out with the technical part of the activities, someone who is experienced or really excited about organizing events and volunteers who will be in direct contact with kids!

					<h4>
						Step 2: Find a venue
					</h4>
					<p>
						Finding an inspiring place to be is important. If you haven’t already got access to a venue, we encourage you to connect with your local hackerspace / makerspace or science center. From our experience the people connected to these places are driven by the same ideals and will support you full on, often giving you free access to their facilities and/or taking an active role on your team.

					<h4>
						Step 3: Set a Date
					</h4>
					<p>
						It’s good to sync with the venue first and see what dates are suitable for them. Once you have a team and venue in place then it’s time to set a date. Since Kids Hack Day can be a full day that is not part of the regular school days we suggest you do the event on a saturday or sunday, or during a public holiday. This date doesn't need to be the final date. As you go through the steps you can adapt this date to make sure you have enough time to make everything work just fine!

					<h4>
						Step 4: Create an entry on our wiki
					</h4>
					<p>
						Create a page in our wiki so everyone else can see you are organizing an event in your city. There you need to put some basic information about your event and it's a great way to gather all the information in one place. The wiki page is the official source of information for your event. You can find a template on how to create your page **here**. Fill as much information as you have to the entry in our wiki so we can have a look at it before licensing your event. This will make it easier for us to provide you with the support you may need. Until you reach the step 9, all this information can and possibly will change so don't worry if you have to make updates!

					<h4>
						Step 5: Activities & Tools
					</h4>
					<p>
						Finding nice activities with the tools you have (or plan to acquire) is a key thing for the success of your event. Activities should be simple. Simple enough so if you show kids how to do it they can instruct other kids by themselves. Keep the volunteers on managing the security and well being of the kids. To help inspire kids, build as many examples and inspirational content as possible, but remember: Keep it simple and let kids build the complexity on top of the simple activities. Make sure to update the wiki page with your activity plan and check our **Activities page** for a list of activities people around the world have made on their KHD events and our partners for deals on products for KHD organizers.

				</div>
				<div class="col-md-7">
					<h4>
						Step 6: Plan the space
					</h4>
					<p>
						Now you have the activities, plan how it will be spread through the space. If you are having tools or activities that liberates flumes (soldering, chemical reactions, strong odors) make sure to plan them to happen on adequate place. Safety is really important, make sure to get all the protection and aid equipments! If there is an activity that involves building, painting or moving around, make sure to book enough space for it to happen. Plan how the inspirational content and tools will be displayed and how kids can get them. If kids need to give the materials back, plan on how to comunicate it with the kids since once they have built their creations it can be very frustrating to leave them behind and it can generate a lot of stress for the organizers. We suggest the creation of stations where kids can perform themed activities and move around freely. If they start building something at the "crafts" station they can move to add a few LEDs at the "light" station, end up by adding a motor to it at the "movement" station and making a funny gif at the "photo booth".

					<h4>
						Step 7: Train with your volunteers
					</h4>
					<p>
						Not everybody needs to be an expert to be a volunteer. It's all about feeling comfortable with the activities and being able to transmit simple and straight forward instructions to the kids. We suggest to gather all the volunteers at least once to go through the tools, space and activities.

					<h4>
						Step 8: Sponsorship
					</h4>
					<p>
						Kids Hack Day is free of charge and to make it happen you will need to find sponsors for a few things like food, space and material. If you can get them all for free, AWESOME! But if not, it's always important to plan how much time, space and material you will have available. Sometimes this step will make yourself reevaluate a few things in your event: Do it! It's never too late.

						All right! You have come this far and it's time to spread to the word about your event. Send and email to carl@kidshackday.com or murilo@kidshackday.com when you have all the previous steps done and on the wiki and we'll send you a few legal terms, license your event and feature it on the KHD page! Make sure to share it with your target audience (or their parents) and if you think it's needed, make a signup page on your favourite service (we use eventbride, it's free for free events).

						Yay! It's the Kids Hack Day today and from now on it's just fun times! Set a time before the event start with your volunteers to setup the space. You can give an extra tour through the activities to test if everything is working. But if something goes wrong, it's just fine. You got here, kids are comming and everything will be fine! Make sure to remove the broken things or just let them around with a "broken" tag or even better a "hack me" tag. Make sure to brand your event with KHD letterings, badges, t-shirts and keep an extra eye to make sure our beloved brand is respected. It took a lot of effort to make it and we love it so much :)

						During the KHD is common that parents reach to organizers to know more about Kids Hack Day, when it will happen again or how they can buy something their kid is playing with. Be prepared to write some emails on a list (online or physical) and check with some of our **partners** that provide discounts for selling their products during the events.

					<p>
						Document your event. This is one thing we are really keen on. It's fun to see other people's faces and how they made their events. If your KHD doesn't look like the ones you've seen in our videos, that's an even stronger reason to document it. We want to grow as a comunity and we are always looking to get as many people represented in our events and engage different countries and cultures. Please share with us a few pictures, videos, gifs, instagram accounts, facebook pages, etc. Everything you have is welcome! Also if you produce a video and it follows a few guidelines we will publish it on our official YouTube channel!
