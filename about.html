				Kid's Hack Day is a global series of 1-day free-of-charge creative tech events for kids. At a KHD event kids 
					are given tools to express their creativity, be curious and express empathy towards each other and the world around 
					them. Ultimately we exist to empower kids to make the world a better place. We do this by giving them tools to reclaim what is increasingly
					being robbed them but what has always been theirs. The future.

				<h2>Kids Hack Day Manifesto</h2>

			<div class="col-md-8">
				<h4>Why hacking?</h4>
		    <p>
		    We believe in the hacker-mindset, which has nothing to do with computers
		    really. We define this mindset as understanding that the world is not
		    static and something you have the power to interact with. The objects
		    around you have all been created by someone who had one particular
		    intention with its use, yes. But the objects around you can also be
		    picked apart, studied, changed, modified and improved to fit your own
		    needs. A fork is for eating because someone told you it is. But a fork
		    can also be an amazing musical instrument, or an interface to a computer.
		    Whatever you imagine, can happen. This mindset is inherit in kids but are
		    too often squashed as they go through traditional education. In this sense,
		    it is as important for us adults to reconnect with this mindset as it is
		    for kids to stay in it.
		    </p>

		    <h4>Every Kids Hack Day event is different.</h4>
		    <p>
		    Because every Kids Hack Day organizer works under radically different
		    conditions each event will also have radically different levels of ambition.
		    Depending on the amount of resources and skills you have access to in your
		    team your event might be super small with only a handful of kids in a tiny
		    local makerspace or school or it might be a massive public event with
		    hundreds of kids attending. We encourage this diversity and organizing a
		    small and humble event is not something that should hold you back, neither
		    should doing a really big one.
		    </p>

		    <h4>Every organizer is different.</h4>
		    <p>
		    Whether you’re into computers, arts, music, science the combined personal
		    interests of you and your team will of course affect the theme of your event.
		    What happens at a Kids Hack Day is not constrained to specific topics and can
		    really incorporate anything (also see
				<a href="{{site.url}}/activities">“what happens at a khd event”</a>
				). While
		    the focus is on technology hacking is really all about a mindset. All Kids
		    Hack Day events are unified through this hacker mindset. A shared belief that
		    if we can invoke the little hacker inside all of us, the world would be a
		    much better place.
		    </p>

				<h4>Every kid is different.</h4>
		    <p>
		    	Kids Hack Day events are all about resourceful use of material and technology to
			    make young kids feel empowered by exposing them to a new way of relating to the
			    world, one where they feel that they are in control over their own future. Attaining
			    this feeling might be done with very different tools and methods because every kid
			    is different and kids are interested in different things. As an organizer it is your
			    job and privilege to encourage all kids to follow their own path, whatever that might
			    be. Inspiring a kid to find their path is probably the most rewarding and inspiring
			    thing you can do.
